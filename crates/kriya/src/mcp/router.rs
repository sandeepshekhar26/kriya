//! Router v2 — **one MCP endpoint that multiplexes multiple governed fronts under one Governor**
//! (service-architecture; the unified `router` entry point). A single Claude Desktop config entry
//! points at `kriya-gateway router`, and that one stdio session governs the **computer-use floor
//! (any app)** *plus* one or more apps' **named reach-in controls** at once — every `tools/call`
//! routed to the right front, all through the **same** policy + signer/audit + actor.
//!
//! ## Why one Governor, not one-per-front
//! Each existing front ([`super::reachin::ReachInServer`], [`super::computeruse::ComputerUseServer`],
//! [`super::proxy_server::ProxyServer`]) wires its own [`Governor`] around its own
//! [`ActionExecutor`]. The router does **not** reimplement those fronts — it *composes* their
//! executors behind a single [`RouterExecutor`], wraps that one executor in **one** [`Governor`],
//! and serves the union of their tools. The result: one policy decides every front, one signing key
//! anchors one audit log, one actor attributes every receipt — the operator governs the whole
//! desktop *and* the specific apps from a single, coherent governance posture.
//!
//! ## Namespacing
//! Every front contributes a `(namespace, Vec<Tool>, Box<dyn ActionExecutor>)`. The router renames
//! each tool to `"<ns>__<original_name>"` (namespace + `"__"` + name) in the served union, and the
//! [`RouterExecutor`] splits an incoming `action_id` on the **first** `"__"` back into
//! `(ns, inner)`, looks up the sub-executor for `ns`, and calls it with the *inner* (un-namespaced)
//! name — exactly the name that front's executor already understands. The `"__"` separator is the
//! standard MCP server-prefix convention and never appears in a synthesized base name (the reach-in
//! synthesizer collapses runs of non-alphanumerics to a single `_`, so a tool name never contains a
//! doubled underscore — see [`super::reachin::synth`]); the computer-use catalog uses single-word
//! `computer_*` names. So the split is unambiguous.
//!
//! ## Policy semantics
//! **Policy rules match the *namespaced* tool name.** An operator gates `cu__computer_click` or
//! `numbers__press_button_delete`, and may use globs against the namespace prefix — e.g.
//! `numbers__*` to govern an entire app's reach-in surface, or `cu__*` to gate the whole
//! computer-use floor. Both `tools/list` filtering and `tools/call` dispatch use the namespaced
//! name, so what the agent sees and what the policy enforces are the same string.
