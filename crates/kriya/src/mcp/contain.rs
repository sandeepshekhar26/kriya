//! Containment (doc 24 §11 B14 / EG-C): force a **launched** agent's network egress through the
//! governed lane so the allowlist, byte budgets, and detection pack (EG-2/EG-P) actually *enforce*
//! instead of merely observing — closing the `curl`/subprocess bypass every governed-lane receipt
//! honestly discloses. This is WATCHER-ROADMAP W4 (macOS launch-under), pulled forward as the
//! parity answer to a competitor's OS-level traffic forcing.
//!
//! ## The spike (doc 24 §11.3, run live before this module was written)
//! `log stream --style ndjson` fidelity for child-subtree exec/file events was measured on real
//! hardware: a marker planted in a child process's argv/environment produced **zero** matching
//! log lines (macOS unified logging does not expose `execve` argv without EndpointSecurity or
//! dtrace-level instrumentation, neither of which this module uses). Per the pre-registered
//! fallback, **containment narrows to egress-only** — this module claims NOTHING about file or
//! process visibility inside the sandbox, only network egress.
//!
//! ## What this actually does
//! 1. [`seatbelt_profile`] generates a Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) profile that denies all outbound
//!    network except a loopback connection to this process's own [`ConnectProxy`] port — verified
//!    working on real hardware (loopback:port succeeds, an external host is refused with
//!    "Operation not permitted").
//! 2. [`ConnectProxy`] is a plain HTTP CONNECT tunnel: it evaluates the requested host against the
//!    installed [`EgressPolicy`], either tunnels the bytes **unmodified** (no TLS termination — the
//!    agent's TLS session is end-to-end intact) or refuses the CONNECT, and emits a signed
//!    `kriya.io.egress.http.{allow,deny}` receipt either way, at the decision point (L10).
//! 3. The `kriya-gateway run -- <cmd>` subcommand (in the binary) bookends a session with
//!    [`RUN_START`]/[`RUN_EXIT`] receipts carrying a `scope_token` — the governed subtree.
//!
//! ## The honest ceiling (say this everywhere this module is described)
//! Covers **only** the process `run --` launches and its children (the `scope_token` subtree).
//! It is a **network-only** profile: file/process/mach access inside the sandbox is unrestricted
//! (`(allow default)` plus the network carve-out) — this is deliberate (the spike above), not an
//! oversight; claiming file/exec coverage here would be exactly the overclaim doc 24 exists to
//! prevent. A raw TCP connection that ignores `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` is *blocked by the
//! profile* (Seatbelt denies `network-outbound` at the kernel/MACF layer, independent of whether
//! the process cooperates) — this is real containment, not a request the agent can politely
//! ignore. What is NOT covered: a determined escape of a fiddly/overly-permissive profile is
//! possible in principle (Seatbelt is deprecated-but-present; the durable seam is rung-3 NetExt,
//! demand-pulled per WATCHER-ROADMAP); plain (non-TLS) HTTP through the proxy is out of scope for
//! v1 (CONNECT-only — most agent/API traffic is HTTPS); and Linux has NO containment path in this
//! module (`kriya-gateway run` is macOS-only in this release — Linux containment rides the W3
//! Tetragon watcher (`kriyawatch`) when it ships, per doc 24 §11.3's documented v1 choice).
//! NEVER claim host-wide coverage — only "agents kriya launches."
