//! The MCP **client** half — the one genuinely new subsystem Front 1 needs. kriya has only
//! ever been an MCP *server* (it exposes an app's actions as governed tools); the stdio
//! governance proxy must also *speak to* a downstream server it spawns as a child.
//!
//! [`McpClient`] spawns the downstream MCP server (`std::process::Command` with piped stdio —
//! the exact pattern already proven in [`super::executor::PersistentProcessExecutor`]), keeps a
//! request-id counter, and exchanges newline-delimited JSON-RPC over the child's stdin/stdout.
//! It reuses the `jsonrpc.rs` types unchanged — the same shapes serve both directions of MCP.
//!
//! The wire transport is split out into a private generic [`Transport`] over `BufRead + Write`
//! so the framing + id-correlation logic is unit-testable with in-memory pipes, no subprocess.
//!
//! std-only by design: no tokio, no async — a synchronous request → response client is all the
//! MVP proxy needs (see `proxy_server.rs`). EOF / broken pipe surfaces as `Err`, never a panic,
//! so a dead downstream degrades into a readable failure rather than taking down the session.
