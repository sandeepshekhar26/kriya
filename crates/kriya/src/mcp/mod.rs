//! Governed MCP-server mode (roadmap **R1**).
//!
//! Exposes a kriya app's registered actions as a Model Context Protocol server over stdio so
//! an *external* agent (Claude Desktop, Cursor, …) can drive the app — but **every
//! `tools/call` is routed through the same policy → approval → budget → signed-audit gates**
//! the in-process agent host enforces. That governed routing, not the raw tool exposure, is
//! the differentiator over a vanilla MCP server: the external agent gets capability, the host
//! keeps control.
//!
//! Layering:
//! - [`jsonrpc`] — wire framing and the MCP message shapes (no policy).
//! - [`executor`] — the trait that actually runs a cleared action (Tauri / sidecar / CLI).
//! - [`approval`] — human-in-the-loop gates for guarded actions in MCP mode.
//! - [`governor`] — wraps policy → approval → budget → audit around the executor.
//! - [`server`] — the stdio JSON-RPC loop that exposes tools and routes calls.
//!
//! The thin `kriya-mcp` binary (`src/bin/kriya-mcp.rs`) wires these together from a policy
//! file + a tool-schema file + an executor command.
