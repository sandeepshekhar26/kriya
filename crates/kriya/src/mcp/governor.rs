//! The governed dispatch core — what makes this an *agent-governance* MCP server and not a
//! vanilla one. Every `tools/call` an external agent makes passes through the exact same
//! gate sequence the in-process host enforces (see `agent::host`):
//!
//! 1. **Policy** — deny-by-default; the host decides, the agent cannot bypass it.
//! 2. **Approval** — actions the policy guards wait for a human (deny by default in MCP mode).
//! 3. **Budget** — a runaway agent is rate-limited before it acts.
//! 4. **Execute** — only now does the cleared action run, via a pluggable executor.
//! 5. **Audit** — every *executed* action gets an Ed25519-signed receipt the agent can't forge.
//!
//! Blocked actions (denied / unapproved / over budget) are *not* signed — receipts attest
//! to what actually ran, matching the in-process host's audit semantics. The block itself is
//! reported back to the agent so it can reason about the refusal.
//!
//! ## The governed-lane I/O ledger (`kriya.io.*`, doc 24 §7.3)
//!
//! When an [`EgressControl`] is installed, a governed call whose destination the resolver names is
//! checked against the egress tier (allow / approval / deny by host + per-destination byte budgets)
//! and produces a standalone `kriya.io.<direction>.<kind>.<decision>` receipt, correlated to its
//! action receipt by a `corr` param (never adjacency). A denied egress is receipted at the decision
//! point, before/instead of execute. This is a governed-lane control, and its honest ceiling is
//! fixed:
//!
//! > *When a stdio MCP server routed through kriya calls an external API, kriya sees — and signs —
//! > only the tool call and result that crossed its stdio pipe; the server's own outbound network
//! > traffic (which hosts it contacted, what it sent) is invisible to kriya and appears in no
//! > receipt. Host-level observation of that traffic is E2.*
