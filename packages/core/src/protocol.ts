/**

 * but the message shapes below are transport-agnostic and mirror JSON-RPC 2.0 semantics:
 * each agent turn is a request/response pair keyed by `stepId`.
 *
 * Flow for one task:
 *   app  --invoke "agent_start"--------▶ host        { goal, state, tools }
 *   host --event  "agent://action"-----▶ app         { stepId, actionId, params, reasoning }
 *   app  --invoke "agent_action_result"▶ host        { stepId, success, data, state }
 *   ...repeat per step...
 *   host --event  "agent://done"-------▶ app         { summary, steps }
 *   host --event  "agent://log"--------▶ app         (inspector telemetry, any time)
